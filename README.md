Welcome to my git repository of the web app MusicBooth for the course Java and Web Development. 

Installation instruction:
You need: <br>
an IDE, either the MusicBooth.war file OR the MusicBoothWebApp.zip file from the docs_phase3 folder( --> I recommend MusicBooth.war), the Apache Tomcat Server 10.1 that can be downloaded here: https://tomcat.apache.org <br>
The MusicBooth.war file is optimized for the Apache Tomcat Server 10.1, which is why it is herer very important that only this server is used. The MusicBoothWebApp.zip could theoretically be used with any server, though I personally have only tried out the previously mentioned. 
1. Download the server and follow the instructions or use an existing server of yours.
2. Download the MusicBooth.war or MusicBoothWebApp.zip file.
3. Open your IDE and choose "Import". Choose the correct file, i.e., "WAR" project or "Archive file system" for example. This changes depending on your IDE and on the chosen file.
         If you chose the.war file, the import possibility might be found under "web".
4. Your IDE will organise the folders for you.
5. You need to connect the server to the IDE, please ensure the connectivity upfront.

The web application:
Generally, the web application is intuitive to use. The code is commented as much as possible and many console outputs provide a continuous status update about the web application. 
I hope you enjoy the application
