<h1>Welcome to the git repository of the web app MusicBooth for the course Java and Web Development.</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>Installation instruction</h2><br>
You need<br>
an IDE of your choice(--> Eclipse recommended), <br>
either the MusicBooth.war file OR the MusicBoothWebApp.zip file from <a href="https://github.com/AHaMomentum/MusicBoothWebApp/tree/main/docs_phase3">here</a>( --> MusicBooth.war recommended),<br>
the Apache Tomcat Server 10.1 that can be downloaded here: https://tomcat.apache.org <br>
The web application could theoretically be used with any server, but has so far been only tested with the one previously mentioned. <br>
<br>
1. Download the server and follow its installation instructions or use an existing server of yours.<br>
2. Download the MusicBooth.war or MusicBoothWebApp.zip file.<br>
3. Open the IDE and choose "Import". Choose the correct file format, i.e., "WAR" project or "Archive file system". This process changes depending on your IDE and on the chosen file. If you chose the .war file, the import possibility might be found under the category "web".<br>
4. Your IDE will structure the folders for you.<br>
5. You need to connect the server to the IDE, please ensure the connectivity upfront.<br>
<br>
Debugging and maintenance:
Generally, the web application is intuitive to use and the code is commented as much as possible, many console outputs provide a continuous status update about the web application. If you stumble across a feature that bothers you or a feature that throws errors, please message me so that I can start debugging. This beta-phase application will be regularly updated until it is decided to completely launch it. <br>
I hope you enjoy the application in its first public testphase. Feel free to give me a feedback! <br>
