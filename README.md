Welcome to my git repository of the web app MusicBooth for the course Java and Web Development. 

I've managed git through the IDE Eclipse, which caused some troubles, though all files of the Web Application now seem to be where they should be. The coordination between the .java files is a bit difficult, I apologise for that.
